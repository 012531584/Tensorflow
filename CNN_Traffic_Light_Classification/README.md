This project uses a CNN structure, introduced in [1], to classify a Kaggle dataset[2] which is derived from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmarks (GTSRB).  
  
In the paper [1], the authors propose two different neural networks to predict the original GTSRB dataset, and in our project we implement the Student Network structure to forecast the Kaggle dataset.  
  
In the Kaggle dataset [2], the original GTSRB dataset is balanced by adding transformated images (brightness and rotation) from original dataset. After that, the balanced dataset is normalized with eight differen techniques to forms eight different files.
