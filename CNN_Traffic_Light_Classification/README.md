This project uses a CNN structure, introduced in [1], to classify a preprocessed dataset derived from German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmarks (GTSRB).  
  
In [1], the authors propose two different neural networks to predict the original GTSRB dataset, and in our project we implement the Student Network structure to forecast the Kaggle dataset.  
  
The preprocessed dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed
